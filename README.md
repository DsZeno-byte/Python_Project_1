# Python_Project_1
# Random Password Generator

This Python project generates a random, secure password of a specified length. The password is composed of a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The password generation is done using a secure random method provided by `os.urandom()` to ensure strong randomness.

## Features

- **Randomized password**: Generates a random password from a set of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.
- **Secure randomness**: Uses `os.urandom()` for generating secure random bytes.
- **Customizable length**: You can specify the length of the generated password.
- **Easy to use**: Just enter the desired password length and get a randomly generated password.

## Installation

No installation required. You can run the script directly with Python.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```
3. You will be prompted to input the length of the password you'd like to generate.
4. The script will then output the generated password.

Example:

```bash
Enter the password length: 12
Your Password is : Gf7&bX!2pQX#
